In this project, access to company data is controlled through an allowed list of IP addresses. “Allow_list.txt” contains approved IP addresses. There are also IP addresses that no longer need access. I’ve created an algorithm to automatically remove restricted IP addresses from the Allow_list.txt so that the list can be up to date at all times.
